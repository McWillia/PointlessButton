# PointlessButton
This game was made during STACSHACK 4 at St Andrews university.

It uses jQuery to hide and show elements as well as to add brand new elements and colour things in exciting ways.

The project got as far the the other branch before the end of the hackathon however I still have plans to do further development and have since made a series of aesthetic and functional changes.

If you want to test functionality and don't want to play the game, use the functions in console:

cheat() - give yourself 1000000 points or so

cheatAgain() - Make the game think you have placed almost enough bets to get the 1% bet chance

showAll() - Shows every button on the page
